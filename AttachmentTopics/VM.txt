A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications.

The industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications. VMs run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the serverâ€™s host OS.
